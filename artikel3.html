            <h3>A Case Against the Term "To**c Masculinity"</h5>
            <p class="p3">
                Is it just me, or is the content it wants to refer to, not that intuitively understood? So according to the most definitions I've read, 
                "toxic masculinity" wants to refer to "open and unspoken laws of masculinity and male stereotypes" which prescribe men continuously to 
                not be sensitive towards themselves or others.
                <br><br>
                Which is interesting because: therefore the action of emotional insensibility irregardless the context is then declared as "toxic". 
                <br>
                The definition sounds empathetic towards the "repressed species"(?) "individual man" while on the other hand it welcomes an universal 
                hostility against broad spectrum of behavior traits which not only men do. 
                <br><br>
                That is where we run into usage issues with this term in everyday life. 
                <br><br>
                -it separates males and females from their behavioral spectrum.
                <br>     
                -to make an extreme form of sensibility a default good, is unrealistic in any sense
                <br>
                -there is a thing called masculine man out there. <br>
                I don't want this species to become even rarer than it already is. The terms' not obvious meaning makes it difficult to distinguish to 
                what masculine traits it wants to refer to as masculinity isn't only defined by commands of "be unsensitive" and "don't cry if you're 
                about to cry". The latter are more very sloppy interpretation of probably emotionally immature parents. 
                <br><br>
                So before we exhibit hostility against men who are for example good, bulky, intolerant against shittyness and masculine, let's instead 
                find other words to describe certain men who act adversly.
