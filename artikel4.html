            <h3>The Name of "Covid-19" should be Sars-2</h5>
            <p class="p3">
                
                If you've lived on planet earth during 2020 and 2022 you might have become aware of a new coronavirus which, after a short phase of just calling 
                it how you wanted it, was officially declared "Covid-19". During that phase where "Covid-19" wasn't established, it was called inter alia "Wuhan 
                Virus" referring to the suspected origin of the virus Sars-Cov-2 (Wuhan, China).

                <br><br>

                Now COVID-19 on the other hand shall be a combination of the failed acronym COVID and a short note of the year when a first patient with that disease 
                was identified (Coronavirus disease 2019), which is suspected to have been on December 31, 2019.

                <br><br>

                Well. To be honest:

                <br><br>

                If this disease was not as prominent and occurred only in one city, to consider this particular naming of the disease wouldn't be a huge problem as not 
                many people would be talking about it anyway or the ones who would be talking about it would have gotten aware of actually the first case which is suspected 
                to have happened in 2019. Taking into consideration the aspect that this disease was used to justify political legislations impacting people worldwide 
                between 2020 and up to 2023, it kinda increased the issues coming from this cognitive dissonance provoking term.

                <br><br>

                Now to elaborate a little deeper, I'll part the name into 2 pieces. COVID as the first and 19 as the second. <br>

                <br>
                The problem with the first bit: <br><br>

                The name itself doesn't refer to any specifics of the disease. Sometimes a disease carries the name of the person who discovered it like in for 
                example, Alzheimer's Disease. Sometimes it actually carries the location where it was discovered like for example Stockholm Syndrome. Sometimes 
                it is an acronym like for example, SARS.

                <br><br>

                Co.vi.D on the other hand is some short version of a non-specific description of a disease while the viral strain of Sars-Cov-2 was already known.

                <br><br>

                Sars-Cov-2 isn't the only viral disease resulting from a coronavirus so to specify that one in that unnecessary rough manner is blurring Sars-Cov-2's 
                uniqueness to the other coronaviruses.

                <br><br>

                The problem with the second bit:

                <br><br>

                What other disease carries a patient 0 timestamp in their name?

                <br><br>

                Now again, if the disease weren't used in justifications of legislations worldwide giving it that gimmick wouldn't be that of a problem but because 
                people outside of Wuhan were talking about the virus, and were impacted by it way beyond 2019, it gives a misleading feature to it like 'the pandemic'
                began in 2019 while the biggest legislative changes and maybe case numbers happened between 2020 and 2022.

                <br><br>

                That is what also inspires the name Co.vi.D-20-22. Though that describes probably better a social phenomenon associated with Sars-Cov-2.

                <br><br>

                So enough of dissecting the flawed naming, let's offer the cure!

                <br><br>

                <strong>SARS 2 .</strong> Very simple, a little short but accurate and relatable.

                <br><br>

                TO BE HONEST.

                <br> <br>

                Co.vi.D-19 sounds creepy with its completely unclear components of understanding the naming 
                with failing the acronym category or usual standards of disease naming; Wuhan Pneumonia would even hit it better.

                <br> <br>

                Sars2 on the other hand gives us a realistic reference point of what you can expect when being tested positive for 
                symptoms as it has huge similarities to SARS but acknowledges its uniqueness with the number 2 (and it's with the Greek alphabet 
                sorted strain variant).

                <br><br>

                2020 and 2022 were chaotic times when novel legislations were quickly issued and impacted people negatively across the world with the 
                justification of a faultily named viral strain. We cannot change the past occurrences but we can change how we move forward when looking 
                at politics-20-22 and SARS-2.
