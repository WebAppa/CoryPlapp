            <h3>A brief article about AGE GAPS in DATING</h5>
            <p class="p3">
                If you find yourself craving to be intimate but you don't know how much you 
                should expand your acceptance circle related to AGE, let me tell you how far you can go and WHY.
                <br><br>
                So 2 rules would be required for that.
                <br></br>
                Rule I :
                <br><br>
                The minimum age you and your partner are allowed to be during sexual cuddling is 19 for women and 21 for men. <br>
                Related to both not being anymore in puberty. Because by default: all pregnancies which occur during puberty are declared as high 
                risk pregnancy. With that very simple guideline you'd straight away avoid multible life- and pregnancy complication of both sexual 
                partners involved.
                
                <!-- Related to both men and women stopped being out of puberty and none of them being by default defined as a high-risk pregnancy case if some semen got itself into the egg cell. -->
                <br></br>
                Rule II :
                <br><br>
                None of the parties can be older or younger than 11 years. <br>
                Related to a pretty simple but great prevention, of the party not being able to be your mother or father because none of the parties, 
                on average hadn't experienced menarche or producing fertile sperm.
                <br><br>
                Gay note: in a way it would also make sense to behave similarly even if you sexually crave the same sex, mostly to avoid over-sexual 
                exposure during puberty or ending up with someone with an odd maturity discrepancy. 
                <br><br>
                BUT: So, naturally, men and women from different generations can have something erotically interesting on them. BUT another issue as 
                well is that with high age-differences between the partners there comes a high risk for divorce, statistically speaking. So when it 
                comes to long-term compatibility high age differences are on average not suitable.
