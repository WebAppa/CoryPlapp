            <h3>Change of Perspective: Depression and Anxiety</h5>
            <p class="p3">

In this century the most of us heard about the theory of the existence of the mental health problems named Depression and Anxiety and some of us as well 
of their sub-forms which might be used indistinguishably in both medical and everyday life context. This sloppiness we allow ourselves with these serious 
diagnoses, can signal the validity of my thesis which I like to put forward for you today: <br><br>

Depr. and anxiety are over-diagnosed in medical settings and having sensations of the conditions in the first place are mostly related to not having enough sex. 
<br><br>
A context where sex doesn't occur in a secure fashion, is single hood. Proud single-hood, a novel phenomena does seem to resonate with people in this century while in 
the past, colloquial speaking, no one was proud to randomly brag about that you're not getting properly laid on the daily basis.(â€¦ Well if we exclude all sexual desire 
tamers but in the time of less effective contraception we give them a respectful pass.) <br><br>
Added to longer and more frequent single hood declarations, infantilizing adults seems of having become more usual as well. We replaced the emotional need for 
these cute little humans with non-cute big strangers. <br>

So; if there are no real babies there was no sex and if there is no sex there is depression and anxiety. 
<br><br>
Let me elaborate; 
<br><br>
First a disclaimer: If I mention sexual intercourse in any way I mean it in heterosexual context and the involvement of high amount of romance and secure attachment. 
<br><br>
To Continue:
<br><br>
So, the idea is: <br>
Men and Women belong together. <br>
If they are not together in the right way, they're stressed, depressed, anxious psychologically speaking. 
<br><br>
We humans have sexual needs, and if these aren't met, we're not that content and not everyone acknowledges that because of the previously mentioned 
"proud singlehood"-trends.
<br><br>
So if depression is mentioned before lifestyle habits, the person in front of you is basically indulging in huge ignorance about that what fills the most 
humans with purpose and content in their lifes.
<br><br>
Besides the component of the result of a sex we have also to mention the trials before and during the baby making: Oxytocin: 
<br>Intercourse or being securely bonded with a strong man or woman we like leads to the release of oxytocin. An important hormone for stress hormone management. 
To interject: <br><br>
Why does it seem like basic psychology is so ignored by the ones who are responsible for handing the diagnoses of the conditions in question? 
<br><br>
Because it's cheaper than to actually care about someone. And I don't mean it as: we humans are selfish bastards. No. But doctors are kinda like whores; 
they see a lot of people. 
And to indulge in everyone's personal life in a nuanced can have a toll on the doctor's personal life. On average we do it with approximately 10 people, 
mostly less than that. 
And we give them usually a special name: namely best Friend. 
<br><br>
So why do we expect from medical professionals to care about more than 5 patients in such a way? 
<br><br>

We can skip the pretending of the existence of these 2 "diseases" and start having epidemic dinner date waves and closure of the faulty prescribing of 
medication with no curative value.

<br><br>
Okay Almost: <br><br>
What I want to say: We should acknowledge that there is no rise in genuine depression and anxiety in people. There is rise in ignorance about basic human needs
because we overestimate everyday-life doctors mental health diagnosing skills which require actually the lifestyle and romance life evaluation before putting 
someone close to such severe diagnosis which is usually put right next to mind and mood altering drug prescription plans.
