            <h3>Why ADHD Is Bullshit and People who Believe in It Belong to a Socially Accepted Cult</h5>
            <p class="p3">

                Because many of us these days had encounters with schools, doctors, universities etc., we've besides other things encountered in this environment 
                the usage of the word "ADHD", which wants to refer to "Attention deficit disorder", which colloquially can be translated to "You are in a boring 
                environment, but it's not socially acceptable for you to express your different preference regarding an opinion or on a setup or a matter.“

                <br><br>

                Naturally, it is important to say not everyone who encounters the above-mentioned institutions will have a confrontation with that type of nonsense 
                diagnosis, but everyone who gets that diagnosis will have been in the mentioned environments.

                <br><br>

                Now we already elaborated  on this blog on the overdiagnosing of depression and anxiety with unveiling some doctors' difficulty to investigate 
                their patient's romantic and sexual status, and now we'll dive a little deeper in the trendy diagnosing of people into 'having ADHD' and why that's 
                problematic.

                <br><br>

                First a few facts before we're diving deeper into the subject :

                <br><br>

                CONVENTIONAL SCHOOL IS NOT THE ONLY FORM YOU CAN EDUCATE YOURSELF WITH. <br><br>

                CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE IS NOT THE ONLY HEALTH CARE YOU CAN TREAT YOURSELF WITH. <br> <br>

                CONVENTIONAL UNIVERSITIES ARE NOT THE ONLY WAY TO BE SUCCESSFUL. <br> <br>

                <br>

                Correct me if I am wrong but these things are correct. These are axioms usually not accepted in the process of diagnosing someone with ADHD. 
                Because these facts are denied by the people who accept or give this diagnosis, it becomes a treatment which favors adaptation to a certain 
                environment, which is seen as ideal.

                <br><br>

                Performing well in conventional schools is ideal, performing well in a doctors' questionnaire is unfortunately also very ideal for prescribing 
                someone a long term treatment plan similar like in depression. These medications don't cure anything, so you have to take them long term. A great 
                way to make money and a great way that doctors can feel important instead of doing the exhausting thing of diving deeper into people lifestyle 
                preferences. <br>
                And lastly, attending a university and doing well there has been viewed as ideal for centuries as well, and we train ourselves to trust mostly 
                these people. (No judgment on the latter, just stating it as an additional fact)

                <br><br>

                That's the cult component.

                <br><br><br>

                Don't get me wrong, these things can be for some or even many people pleasurable activities, even actually going to the doctor and immersing in 
                self-reflection about your personality and body, but appointing a certain route as the best one to reach Rome and shooting others who prefer a 
                different route is absolutely unnecessary. Instead of spending these resources for establishing a linear system which wastes a lot of resources 
                on reducing peoples' differences between each other, we could instead spend it more on pro-social endeavors which accommodate people with for 
                example different learning preferences in addition to the ones we're already serving well.

                <br><br>

                Now the term neurodiversity has been also established in recent years which to be honest sounds a bit weird, because you could argue that absolutely 
                everyone is neurodiverse to the next fellow human, so why even mention it? Now you might then argue that this term focuses more on severe differences
                 like an excessive need to be physical active. But alternatively, instead of calling the person neurodiverse, you can also call it a genuine preference
                  for physical activity or a certain neurological degeneration which lets a person lose control over their body if you have Parkinson's for example. 
                  Parkinson's disease can coerce affected people to shake their hands frequently. Actually, even calling it that way feels like you're describing 
                  Parkinson's wrong because shaking hands is voluntarily while those type of tremors are significantly more involuntarily.

                  <br><br>

                  Now before you want to argue then, that you can compare it with "ADHD“, you're totally wrong as you can survive things defined as "ADHD“ 
                  absolutely without medication, and you won't have a miserable life doing so. (Here miserable being defined with lacking autonomy because 
                  of symptoms of a condition). That's the difference between a disease and bullshit which people tell each other, to conform to a socially 
                  accepted cult.

                  <br><br>

                  An additional problem with people who spread the term 'ADHD' like it is a something serious we should treat on yourself or a fellow human 
                  is, that it makes us also less humane. Because instead of actually listening to someone who seems bored while we do something where we 
                  invited the person to or asking question and accepting their genuine answers and opinions, we rather give people, even a child whose body 
                  and mind is not fully developed yet, drugs which affect the child's personality, and we explain to the child that that's the purpose.

                  <br><br>

                  Doctors and some parents should maybe just tell their children and underage patients "Fuck you, I don't care what you're interested in, 
                  how you feel isn't valid!“ instead of insulting them terribly in that passive way and predisposing their child to be a highly obedient 
                  cult member forever.

                  <br><br>

                  Last words about the "It is a part of a cult“- thing: <br>
                  At this point in time I would argue it's not a bad thing to be part of a cult. So being a cult member is alright BUT NOT if you start feeding 
                  people who live within and around the cult, with drugs in order to fit better into the cult.

                  <br><br>

                  Especially when it is about children as that creates terrible conditions to determine how voluntarily someone is actually in the cult. It is 
                  particularly dangerous and too intrusive when mind-altering drugs are prescribed in order to press a person into the cult and not the other way 
                  around change the cult to suit the human or that not a cult at all is fine as well.

                  <br><br>
