                <br><br>
                So; educated in basically everything I am here to teach you guys ...just kidding! But <br>
                you have to read the articles, guys. It's worth it! Like you might perceive a few topics as "does this really matter?" and the answer is 
                <span>YES and NO</span><span> you won't physically die I guess if you're not reading them, but you'll be more in peace if you do </span>  <br>
                <span>because some bullshit people confuse as the truth is causing unnecessary hardship.</span><br><br>
                    <span>The ones who wonder why can receive inspiration and answers here for some of these why-questions!</span>
                <br><br>
                Peace!
